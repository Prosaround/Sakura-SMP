# Sakura SMP Modpack

***COMPATIBLE WITH 1.20.1***

Any other versions might break or crash your game.

Iris or Fabric must be installed to use this modpack, with both needing Fabric version 0.15.11 (latest tested). We also recommend using JAVA 17 for compatibility reasons. If you are using Fabric, make sure to put the mods (.jar files) in the root Minecraft folder, at .minecraft/mods. If you are using Iris (Iris installation must be on Fabric 0.15.11), replace 1.20.1 folder in .minecraft/Iris-reserved folder. Can be used outside of the server as well.
